# Churn
Telecom customer churn prediction
Customer churn is calculated by the number of customers who leave your company during a given time period. 
In a more down-to-earth sense, churn rate shows how your business is doing with keeping customers by your side.
Churn is a real headache for many companies as it shows how good (or bad) they are at keeping customers by their side.
From a company point of view, it is necessary to gain this information because acquiring new customers is often arduous and costlier than retaining old ones.
Hence, the insights gained from Churn Prediction helps them to focus more on the customers that are at a high risk of leaving.

Dataset : 
In our data collection, there are about equal numbers of male and female clients.
Only 30% of all customers have dependents, compared to about 50% of customers who have a partner.
Only roughly half of the customers who have a spouse also have a dependant, while the other half have no independents.
In addition, as predicted, the majority (80%) of customers who do not have a partner do not have any dependents.
I also examined any gender-based disparities in the percentage of clients having dependents and partners.
The distribution of them by gender is the same. Furthermore, there is no gender difference in senior citizen status.
